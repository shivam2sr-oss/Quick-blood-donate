# Quick-blood-donate
Developed a full-stack Centralized Blood Donation and Management System using Spring Boot, J2EE, React.js, and PostgreSQL, with secure backend communication through RESTful APIs. The system is designed to connect blood donors, collection nodes, and hospitals on a single platform, enabling real-time blood availability tracking and faster emergency response. Implemented JWT-based authentication and Spring Security for role-based access control and system security. Built a responsive frontend using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Lucide React, and integrated Spring Mail for automated email notifications related to blood requests, donations, and status updates. The application follows SOLID principles and layered architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean code structure.
